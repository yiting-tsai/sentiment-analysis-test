## 🎯 Goals

Train a multilingual text classifier that predicts the sentiment polarity of a given text.

Possible sentiments:
* `positive`
* `negative`
* `neutral`

## 📊 Datasets

* `data/train.csv`: a training dataset containing 25k multilingual texts annotated with their corresponding sentiment
* `data/test.csv`: a test dataset containing 2500 multilingual texts

## 📖 Rules

* Code should be written in Python 3
* Code should be easily runnable, provide a pip requirements.txt file or a conda environment.yml file describing code dependencies
* Code should be documented to explain your methodology, choices, and how to run and get results
* Code should output a file `predictions.csv`, containing the predictions of your best classifier on the test dataset
